									<h2>My Project</h2>
									<h5>Overview:</h5>
									<p>My idea for an IT project would be a chatbot which is used on many platforms; Android/IOS, web-based and a physical medium. This chatbot create a complete PC system build for a customer by asking relevant and intuitive questions regarding what their main uses for the computer would be and sifting through selected answers to the prescribed questions and creating a complete PC build for the customer’s need. The physical, mobile, and web-based chatbots would all be the same, but target a separate audience, for more youth, it would be the app based, but for those who don’t have a phone or struggle using a computer/web-based platform would try the physical instore chatbot.</p>  
									<h5>Motivation</h5>
									<p>According to “Bustle.com”, on average, a desktop pc lasts around 4 years till it needs a major upgrade. The need for custom built systems is prevalent, this is my main motivation for my project that there is an ongoing market for consumers who need a new computer system. This is where the chatbot comes in. Using a simple touchscreen interface, the chatbot can ask any user their needs and requirements for computer and based of that information can provide a full configured system build which then the customers can purchase.

									<h5> What is the service?</h5>
									<p> My main features of the service are supported on how the chatbot works. 
										For instore consumers, if a customer comes into a brick and mortar store ie; Harvey Norman, they greeted with simple touchscreen-based booth. The premise of the booth would allow customers to come in and physically answer the questions on screen and if need have an employee who knowledgeable regarding the system to help if there is any problem. <br>
										<br>
										The main style of how the chat bot works is it will ask very simple yes or no question. This will allow for anyone customer no matter the age difference to be able to understand the questions and answer based on their need so that they can get a pc personalised for them. These questions would be; Are you a gamer, are you a graphic designer or video producer, these would eliminate all graphics cards from the end system, saving consumers money. For those who are elderly it would ask them what kind of size of the pc system they would want it. This would eliminate all large ATX motherboard in preference of mATX motherboards and thus larger cases. The chatbot would also ask if they store a lot of movies/tv shows/ photos. If they do, they would prioritize larger HDD, and maybe add a SSD if necessary. The result would printout a list of the built system specs and price, and the customer would be able to purchase and get it built that day.<br>
										<br>
										The secondary feature would be the building of the pc. Once the customer buys the computer, the build list is sent to the build station off site. Here employees would receive the part list and build the system based on when the customer wants it by. If they pay extra for same day building their custom pc build would be prioritized compared to those who didn’t pay for same day build. In addition to the service, the customer can use the specially generated build code which allows them to track the progress of their build, down to the component. Eg. There would be a button the builder would press based on what component they would be inserting into the case. This would allow the consumer to know what point the builder is up to and gives an estimation of when the computer will be able to be picked up.<br>
										<br>
										For those youth or people on the go, the mobile/web-based service provides the same outcome but with a user-friendly UI. It has the same function with the yes or no question chatbot, but it says the user having to go into the store to purchase the computer. The service will also have a home deliver component so that from the comfort of your home you can order. And that the consumer is guaranteed that for the answers provided the pc system is right for them.<br>
										<br>
										This chatbot/service can be implemented into any brick and mortar store; Ie. JBHIFI, Harvey Norman, The Good Guys. Where people can trust what they are getting is right for them.

									
									
									
									<h5>Tools and Technology:</h5>
									<p>The main tools and technology needed for this project to work would be chatbot booth setup up in a way which is simple, clean and user friendly. In terms of the language the chatbot it running, it would be running Python, as it is able to make more AI decision based of the responses given with the help of the implementation of OpenAI. For the pc building side of things, the need for a clean and static free workplace, with all tools need for putting together a pc and static resistant wrist straps. In addition, the app and web-based platforms will both use the Python program through a HTTP service, as the app will essentially run the website shaped for the phone in use.</p>
									<h5>Skill required</h5>
									<p>The main skill required would be a group of software engineers who can code a chatbot to respond to simple yes and no answers also be able to put together a system build based on those answers. For the building side of the service, the employees should have extensive knowledge in system building should any problem with the build arise. In terms of find people for the job, it shouldn’t be too difficult as the IT industry is ever growing and the need for IT trained people is growing, so finding people right for the job shouldn’t be too hard. </p>
									<h5>Outcome</h5>
									<p>The main outcome of this project is that the original problem with people not knowing where to go to find information and help in building a system, are able to use a simple chatbot interface to determine for what there needs what kind of PC they need. This would open a service which anyone can use to find a PC right for them. The overall impact would be the realisation that we are living in the current generation where PC’s are all around us, and not everyone knows how to build on let alone come up with hardware for someone else to build one. It would force companies to widen their overall knowledge of the IT industry to one where anyone can easily get help.</p>
