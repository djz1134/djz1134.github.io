									<h2>My Ideal Jobs</h2>
									<h3> In Australia</h3>
									<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38568652?searchrequesttoken=78db06c9-598f-4f55-942a-41d74eb11a40&type=standard	">Telecommunications field engineer for Fibre Dynamics Engineering Pty Ltd:</a>

									This job caught my attention, as I would like to work in the telecommunications industry, but I would prefer not to do a lot of programming and would like to do more hands-on work. This combines both hands-on and working on a part of IT I enjoy and find interesting.</p>

									<h3> In England	</h3>
									<a href="https://www.reed.co.uk/jobs/project-engineer/37542130?source=searchResults#/jobs/telecommunications-field-engineer-jobs">Project Engineer at Hyperoptic Ltd:</a>
									<h5>Position:</h5>
									It is a job which connects businesses to a gigabit internet service, providing service and support to multi-occupancy companies in urban places around the UK.
									This job caught my attention, as I would like to work in the telecommunications industry, but I would prefer not to do a lot of programming and would like to do more hands-on work. This combines both hands-on and working on a part of IT I enjoy and find interesting. Being more specific I would like to learn how fibre optic cable is laid and how it all connects to the internet.
									<h5>Skill, Qualifications and experience:</h5>
									<p>The ad doesn’t specifically say what qualifications are needed, but based of the previous ad, I would assume it requires a bachelor telecoms, or IT or similar to apply for the position. Also the need for previous experience in either laying down fibre optical or servicing the technology.</p>

										<h4>My Current Qualifications</h4>
									</header>
									<p>Currently studying a bachelors of Technology (Computing Studies), I have very basic knowledge regarding networking as I am currently doing a networking course run in conjugation with the Cisco Academy. Just were my interest lie, I have configured and troubleshooted network and NBN related troubles at home and at other family members houses. I haven’t had a lot of experience in this type of work. My main goal would to focus and try and finish all the networking elective in conjugation with my current course. This would allow me to at the end of my studies be a registered cisco engineer which will then allow me to continue and try to find internship or jobs which allow me to ghost other more experienced workers to further develop my understanding and skill with the type of work I want to do. This may take a couple of more years but ultimately will assist me in reaching my goal to become a qualified and recognised telecommunications field engineer.</p>
